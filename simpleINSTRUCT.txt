You will take an input PNG or JPG photo and use the latest technology to perform a ±30 degree rotation, similar to Zero-1-to-3 models. Manipulate the source image by identifying the subject area, removing the background, and then passing it to a Zero-1-to-3 type model for rotation. Generate 3 total images: the first with a +30 degree rotation, the second as the original (background removed), and the third with a -30 degree rotation.

Aim for high-quality results using simple code. Do not overcomplicate the objective. Simplicity and functionality are more important than elaborate formatting or unnecessary features. Follow published package documentation wherever possible.

This task should be straightforward. Create a local host UX where the user uploads a photo, adjusts settings, and sees a GIF preview of the 3 generated images. When the user clicks 'export', save the 3 frames to a user-specified directory.

Follow these instructions step by step:
(1) Plan the project into 3 clear steps.
(2) Implement the plan by building the code.
(3) Test the implementation using the examplePhoto.png file in the project directory.

After step 3, the app should be ready to use. Ensure the app is run by a super simple CLI that can be run out of any terminal.
